In the event that the return request is declined, the user shall not be eligible for a refund, and Yogwe assumes no liability in this regard. Further, in the event that the user fails to accept the receipt of the said re-shipped product, the user shall continue to be not eligible for a refund, and Yogwe assumes no liability with respect to the return or refund for the said re-shipped product.
