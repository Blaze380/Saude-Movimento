If the product returned by the user is used, damaged or if the original tags are missing, the user’s return request shall be declined, and the said product shall be re-shipped back to the customer. In the event that the return request is declined, the user shall not be eligible for a refund, and Yogwe assumes no liability in this regard. Further, in the event that the user fails to accept the receipt of the said re-shipped product, the user shall continue to be not eligible for a refund, and Yogwe assumes no liability with respect to the return or refund for the said re-shipped product. In addition, these Terms of Use may be further supplemented by Product specific conditions, which may be displayed with that Product.</p>
